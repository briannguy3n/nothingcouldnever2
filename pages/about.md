nothing is a producer and DJ based in Toronto, Canada. Drawing from house, trance, and emotive electronica, his music blends hypnotic rhythms with heart-stirring melodies. It's music made for crying in the club or losing yourself on the dancefloor -- in equal measure.

Steadily moving from strength to strength in Canada's underground, you can find him playing warehouse parties or intimate late-night sets. While in the studio, his productions chase euphoria head-on. Everything is still evolving, finding its edges. That's intentional. 

nothing exists in the spaces between genres, between scenes, between the high and the comedown—and that's exactly where he wants to stay.
