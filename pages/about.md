  <div class="about-text">
    <p>nothing is a producer and DJ based in Toronto, Canada. Drawing from house, trance, and emotive electronica, his music blends breakbeat rhythms with heartfelt melodies. It's music made for crying in the club or losing yourself on the dancefloor.</p>
    
    <p>Steadily moving from strength to strength in Canada's underground, you can find him playing warehouse parties or intimate late-night sets. While in the studio, his productions chase euphoria head-on. Everything is still evolving, finding its edges.</p>
    
    <p>nothing exists in the spaces between genres. And he'll build there anyway.</p>
